# HockeyBotTrain
Code to train the LSTM that powers HockeyBot, a Facebook Messenger chatbot. 

HockeyBot assumes that the words is receives from the user are the beginning of an NHL player or coach's interview. It responds with that message, continued for 5 sentences from a generic player/coach. 

The LSTM is trained on NHL interview transcripts scraped from [ASAP Sports](http://www.asapsports.com/). 

Follow this Facebook Messenger [link](m.me/102447081166159) to see the bot. It is currently under review by Facebook, so only myself and testers can use it.
